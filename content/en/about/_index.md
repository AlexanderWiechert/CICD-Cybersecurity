## The Continuous Delivery Foundation

The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of
many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous integration/continuous
delivery (CI/CD). It fosters vendor-neutral collaboration between the industry’s
top developers, end users and vendors to further CI/CD practices and
industry specifications. Its mission is to grow and sustain projects that are
part of the broad and growing continuous delivery ecosystem.
