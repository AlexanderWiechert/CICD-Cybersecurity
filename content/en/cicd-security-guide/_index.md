Securing your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is no longer optional—it’s essential. This website is your go-to resource for building, implementing, and optimizing secure CI/CD workflows. Whether you’re a developer, DevOps engineer, or security professional, we provide information on the open-source tools and guidance you need to model security at every stage of your pipeline. From securing code and builds to monitoring post-deployment environments, our hub empowers teams to integrate security seamlessly into their workflows without sacrificing speed or agility. Explore, learn, and transform your CI/CD processes into a fortress of innovation and resilience.

The CI/CD Workflow has been segmented into three 3 major phases:
- Code and Prebuild - this section includes security tooling for the earliest points in the CI/CD workflow.
- Build and Deploy - this section covers security tooling for both the build step and deployment step, regardless of where the deployment is occuring (test or production).
- Post Deploy - Security does not stop after the binaries have been deployed. This section covers continuous vulnerability management and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
