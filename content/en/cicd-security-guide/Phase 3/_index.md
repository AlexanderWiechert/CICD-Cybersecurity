## Introduction

The post-deploy stage of your software delivery pipeline is where your application is live and actively serving users. While much of the focus in DevSecOps is on securing code, builds, and deployments, ensuring robust security doesn’t end there. The post-deploy phase is critical for monitoring, maintaining, and adapting to new threats in real time.

This phase includes tools and practices for continuous monitoring, vulnerability patch management, and incident response. From runtime application self-protection (RASP) to real-time threat detection and log analysis, post-deploy security ensures your application remains secure, compliant, and reliable in production.

## Compliance Goals

Compliance Policies and Practices are being defined across both public and private sectors. Specifically, the US Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity and the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) aim to define how to manage threats and vulnerabilities by establishing standardized frameworks for cybersecurity requirements. These frameworks cover the complete software development process, from design through ongoing monitoring of production software assets.
