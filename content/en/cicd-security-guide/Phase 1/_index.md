## Introduction

Integrating security into every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is more critical than ever. The code and prebuild stage is foundational to creating secure, reliable, and high-performing applications. Failing to address vulnerabilities early can lead to costly fixes, data breaches, and reputational damage down the line.

This section provides a comprehensive guide to the essential security tools that developers and DevOps teams should use during the code and prebuild phase to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated before they can cause harm. From Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to dependency scanning and secure CI/CD pipelines, the right tools can help you adopt a proactive approach to software security while maintaining development velocity.

## Compliance Goals

Compliance Policies and Practices are being defined across both public and private sectors. Specifically, the US Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity and the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) aim to define how to manage threats and vulnerabilities by establishing standardized frameworks for cybersecurity requirements. These frameworks cover the complete software development process, from design through ongoing monitoring of production software assets.

The inclusion of security tooling in the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is one crucial area where policy and practices can be implemented and automated. With the rapid pace of development and deployment in modern DevOps environments, security must be seamlessly embedded into each phase of the pipeline to protect applications and data from vulnerabilities and attacks.
